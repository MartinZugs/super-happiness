This is the website for Loyola's Computer Science Club, DON'T PANIC!

It will be written using React and Semantic UI.

The purpose of this website is to have a place for members to see the future events of the club, a brief overview of the club and what it does, and the exec board members.

Contact form functionality is a high priority and will be added immediately after the above features. Implementation is TBD, but easiest option at this point is probably to use a service like https://formspree.io/.
